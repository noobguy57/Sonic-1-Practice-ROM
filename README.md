# Sonic-1-Practice-ROM

This ROM is very similar to my Sonic 2 Practice ROM. However, it was also used as a bit of experimentation with in-game savestates using SRAM.

Figured we would release this so that it wasn't sat on for a while. If there are any bugs or oddities, most can be fixed with a stage restart or death, but let me know.

Below are the respective HUD values.

When in the in game menu (accessed by pressing up and c when paused), please note any input on A B or C will count as a selection. If you want to exit the menu, head to the "ADIOS" option and select that.
Note that loading a blank savestate will freeze the game. I am unsure if save states are kept when console or emulator is powered off. This may depend on your setup, but not entirely sure.

Anyways, have fun and let us know if there are weird bugs. 

Eventually, I'd like to polish this ROM a bit more, but all 3 of us are quite busy and have priorities elsewhere. It's on the docket, and it's on the docket to bring more features and also bring these features to other ROMs.
